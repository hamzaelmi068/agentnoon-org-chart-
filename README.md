# ðŸ“Š Agentnoon Org Chart Visualizer

This project is a Vue + Tailwind application built as part of the Agentnoon coding test. It visualizes a large-scale organizational hierarchy using CSV data, and calculates insightful reporting metrics like descendant counts, IC cost, manager cost, and cost ratios.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** (Composition API, `<script setup>`)
- **Tailwind CSS** for layout and visual styling
- **PapaParse** for robust CSV parsing
- **No TypeScript**, per prompt instructions

---

## ðŸ§  Key Features

âœ… Upload and parse the provided 40k+ row CSV  
âœ… Expand/collapse org tree nodes interactively  
âœ… Recursively count descendants per employee  
âœ… Calculate:
- **IC Cost** â€“ sum of all salaries of individual contributors  
- **Management Cost** â€“ sum of all salaries of people with reports  
- **Total Cost** â€“ total cost of a subtree (excluding self)  
- **Manager:IC Ratio** â€“ clean 2-decimal display, edge-handled  

âœ… Performance-optimized: only renders a limited tree depth to avoid crashing  
âœ… Clean, simple UI (with emojis!) that reflects user-friendly visual hierarchy

## ðŸ§ª How to Use

1. Upload the provided CSV (`giga-corp.csv`)
2. Wait for the tree to render (CEO appears at the top)
3. Expand nodes to explore nested team structures
4. Hover/read values to understand cost breakdowns and ratios

---

## ðŸ’¡ Design Notes

- Rendering is limited to 3 levels deep to preserve performance in-browser  
- Recursive computations are memoized via `computed()`  
- All logic is housed in a single recursive `OrgNode.vue` component  
- Salaries are parsed and sanitized (removing commas and formatting)  
- Tailwind used for responsive layout and intuitive hierarchy display
